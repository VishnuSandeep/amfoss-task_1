1.The *, -, /, + are operators and 'hello', -88.8, 5 are values
2.spam is variable and 'spam' is string.
3.float,integer and string are 3 types of data types
4.An expression is madeup of values and operators and they evaluate down into a single value. example: 2+3 = 5
5.An expression evaluates down to a single value and a single value is also considered as a expression whereas variable does not evaluate down to a single value and cannot have a single value.
6.The value of the variable does not change because bacon + 1 is an expression and evaluates down to a single value 21 as bacon = 20. It has no change.
7.The 2 expression evaluates to a single value as spamspamspam and the first one as 'spam' + 'spamspam' is known as string concatenation and 'spam'*3 is known as string replication.
8.eggs is a valid name and 100 is invalid because we cannot have names starting with number.
9.The 3 functions that can be used to get the integer,floating-point number, string version of a value are int(), float(), str() respectievely.
10.The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' causes an error because either 2 string can be added or 2 integer can be addded but integer and string cannot be added so thats why it causes an error.
